# SAMCategories

A collection of useful [Foundation](SAMCategories/Foundation) and [UIKit](SAMCategories/UIKit) categories.

SAMCategories are tested on iOS 6 and Mac OS 10.8 and requires ARC. The will probably work on lower deployment targets though. Released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

## Installation

Simply add the files in the `SAMCategories/Foundation` and/or `SAMCategories/UIKit` to your project. If you add the Foundation categories, you'll need to add `SAMCategories/SAMCategories.bundle` to your project as well. Make sure the bundle is copied to your application's resources.

If you're using CocoaPods, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

``` ruby
pod 'SAMCategories'
```

Enjoy.
