Vandy Vans
==========

Vandy Vans is an open-source iPhone project created by [Vanderbilt University](http://vanderbilt.edu) students through a student organization called [VandyMobile](https://www.facebook.com/VandyMobile).

The purpose of the app is to provide a fast, native way for Vanderbilt students to access the van schedule as well as a live map of the vans' locations on their iPhones.
